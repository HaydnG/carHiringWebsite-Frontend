## Running and building project

### With backend

If using with the backend, the '-buildall' argument can be past to the server to build the frontend into the correct location for the backend golang server.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
